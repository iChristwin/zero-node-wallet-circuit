# Wallet Verification Circuit

This code implements a Halo 2 circuit for verifying a wallet address.

**Key Features:**

- Uses a `WalletChip` to encapsulate wallet-related constraints.
- Defines a `WalletCircuit` to represent the overall verification logic.
- Includes a test case to demonstrate usage.

**Usage:**

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   cargo install halo2-proofs
   ```
2. Run the test:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

**Code Structure:**

- **`WalletChip`**:
   - Encapsulates the constraints for verifying a wallet address.
   - Includes a `configure` method to set up the constraints.
- **`WalletConfig`**:
   - Stores configuration data for the `WalletChip`.
- **`WalletCircuit`**:
   - Represents the overall verification circuit.
   - Implements the `Circuit` trait for integration with Halo 2.
   - Includes methods for configuration and synthesis.
- **`tests` module:**
   - Contains a test case to verify a sample wallet address.

**Additional Notes:**

- The code uses a `MockProver` for testing purposes.
- For real-world usage, you'll need to use a proper Halo 2 prover.
